## 2. Student Pathways

### 2.1 Full-Course (In-House) Students
Students completing the entire SSI Open Water Diver course (confined water, theory, and open water dives) with Dive India over four days.

### 2.2 Referral Students
Students who have completed part of their training (usually with a dive center in their city) and arrive with:
- Completed confined water (pool) training
- Swim/snorkel test completed
- Theory sessions and final exam passed
- Referral paperwork documenting above

Referral courses at Dive India consist of two training days with four open water dives.

## 3. Certification Pathways

### 3.1 Open Water Diver (OWD)
- Full certification under ISO 24801-2 (Autonomous Diver)
- Requirements per SSI standards: 4 open water dives, mastery of all required skills, completion of academics and theory exam
- Max depth: 18m / 60ft, dive with buddy in conditions similar to training

### 3.2 Scuba Diver (SD)
- Partial certification under ISO 24801-1 (Supervised Diver)
- Requirements: Minimum 2 open water dives, mastery of Scuba Diver subset of skills
- Max depth: 12m / 40ft, under direct supervision of a dive professional
- Upgradeable to OWD with further training

### 3.3 No Certification
Issued when a student cannot meet the requirements for either OWD or SD (e.g., unwilling to perform core skills despite training attempts).

**Instructor Guidance:**
- In such cases, issue a recognition of participation or a formal statement of training (non-certifying).
- Remind student of upgrade options if they choose to continue training in the future.
